## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover/active states for all interactive elements
- Enjoy subtle animations on scroll and hover


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://dazzling-gumdrop-2ceeb7.netlify.app/
- Solution / Repo URL: https://github.com/Aiman-7/Clipboard-Landing-Page-Project

## Features

- Responsive layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Smooth hover states and button effects
- Simple, maintainable structure (pure HTML & CSS)
- Font Awesome social icons
- Scroll-based animation on key visuals

---

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, media queries)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font Awesome for icons

### What I learned

Some highlights from this build:

```css
.home-button1:hover {
  background-color: hsl(171, 44%, 62%);
  border-bottom: 3px solid hsl(171, 62%, 43%);
  scale: 0.9;
}
````

* Using `scale` for subtle hover feedback
* Leveraging `animation-timeline: view()` for scroll-based animations
* Structuring responsive media queries cleanly and progressively

### Continued development

Things I’d like to explore next:

* Integrate JavaScript for interactivity
* Extract more values into CSS custom properties for theming
* Convert this into a React or Next.js component-based version
